          <p>
            I started my career <span>5 years ago</span> as a Recruitment
            Manager for tech profiles before moving on to Project Manager roles,
            focusing on digital transformation. During this time, I was
            simultaneously <span>happy to learn new things</span>, but also
            increasingly frustrated with not deeply understanding the technical
            issues I was working with, delegating that task to other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led me to pursue a{" "}
            <span>certification in Web Development with Ironhack</span>, where I
            graduated top of my class. I now wish to apply my newfound knowledge
            in a fast-paced environment, where I can keep on learning, and
            hopefully one day, create opportunities for other people to learn
            from me as well. My previous experiences have proven me to be a{" "}
            <span>fast learner</span>, to be able to adapt very quickly to new
            environments and always make my colleagues <span>smile</span>! I am
            confident that I have the skills and thirst to learn that will
            enable me to thrive in this new stage of my professional career.
